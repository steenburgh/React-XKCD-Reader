# React-XKCD-Reader
http://react-xkcd-reader.duncansteenburgh.com

A rewrite of [steenburgh/XKCD-Reader](http://www.github.com/steenburgh/XKCD-Reader) using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.com/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).  
The app is hosted using Firebase.

## Features
* View all XKCD comics including the latest comic
* Cache previously viewed comics for speedy navigation 
* Keyboard navigation via Left/Right arrow keys
* Hover to view alt Text
* Fancy Loader :)


*Initial setup of this project was a lot faster thanks to starter code in [mseman/proto](http://www.github.com/mseman/proto)*
